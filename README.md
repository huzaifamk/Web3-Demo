# How to Code, Deploy, and Interact with a Polygon (MATIC) Smart Contract

## Quickstart

1. `npm install`
2. Rename `.env-example` to `.env`, and populate the variable values.
    1. Grab `API_URL` from [www.alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com/?a=polygon-smart-contract) by setting up a Polygon Mumbai testnet app.
    2. For `PRIVATE_KEY`, use your Ethereum wallet address's corresponding private key.
    3. You can leave `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` blank until you deploy with `npx run scripts/sample-script.js`, then grab the address where you deployed your contract to.
    4. `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` is very similar to `API_URL` except you can remove the http or ws prefix.
    5. `MATIC_URL` you can grab from [www.alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com/?a=polygon-smart-contract) but make sure your Alchemy app is a Polygon Mainnet app.
3. run `npx run scripts/sample-script.js --network mumbai` to deploy your contract to Mumbai testnet
4. run `npx run scripts/greet.js --network mumbai` to modify blockchain state by calling the Greet function on your smart contract.
5. Repeat those steps with `--network matic` to deploy and interact on Polygon (MATIC) mainnet chain.
